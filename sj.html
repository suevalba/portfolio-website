            I don't have any experience in social scavenging or any type of game
            related to scavenger hunting. It is challenging to start creating an
            app I am not familiar with.

            <p>
              “Gamers need a way to enjoy social scavenger games for real
              objects because they want to play social interactive games with
              friends even when on the go”

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Can be time consuming to set up since it needs to be
                    tailored to an accurate address and neighborhood

                  <li>
                    With GPS and mobile data turned on, it could consume a lot

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The app can support auto complete to easily fill out needed
                    information with less time
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Activate GPS on phones and share location to the players

                  <li>
                    Players are encouraged to download offline GPS mode for a
                    more accurate location if GPS signal gets lost
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Players will have an option for battery saving mode where
                    they can play with dark screen, or use Wi-Fi when present

          <h2>Surveys and Interviews</h2>
          <p>
            The surveys and interviews determines the behaviors and general
            attitude of the users. In this app, it also includes identifying
            their attitude towards social media and how it influences their
            daily lives. These goals will help me discover how users will enjoy
            social scavenger hunting and uncover possible problems they could
            encounter during the game. Google Forms is a helpful tool to analyze
            their responses.
          </p>
          <h4>Insights</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Top social media platforms are Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.
              The main purpose of their social media platforms are to connect
              with friends, family, co-workers, for learning and discovering,
              and lastly for entertainment and games.
            </li>
            <li>
              Since the participants are active on social media, I think playing
              Schnitzeljagd that aims to play with other players will be
              successful except there’s a little chance to play with strangers
              in the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              What participants enjoy the most in scavenger hunting is mostly
              trying to solve riddles, finding clues discovering unknown places
              while having fun with friends
            </li>
            <li>
              The most difficult part of playing was if they couldn’t understand
              the questions, they wouldn't be able to find the clues, so they
              won’t be able to solve the riddles and finish the game
            </li>
            <li>
              Participants enjoyed scavenger hunting when solving riddles
              together with friends. They begin to discover places that they see
              everyday but never thought it actually exist in their everyday
              lives. The experience that they have, the funny moments and
              memories with friends brought a sense of accomplishment and
              working with a team is the most fun part of the game.

                Some events are time limited. I miss the event when I don’t have

              <li>I hope they add more specific clues</li>
              <li>I wish there’s a navigation arrow point</li>

              <li>

                I was concerned of my safety because I find Pokémons in unsafe

            <h4>Solutions</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                When a rare treasure is to be found, we need to place several
                items in places and consider the number of players or users in a
                specific location. We shouldn’t concentrate in just one specific
                location the world
              </li>
              <li>
                In providing instructions, adding a directional arrow is more
                efficient for the players to follow the map
              </li>
              <li>Instructions and clues should be clear and simple</li>
              <li>
                Special events can be done at least 24 hours depending on the
                time zone to accommodate other players who are not available on
                that time period
              </li>
              <li>
                Create clues and solutions according to skills of the players
              </li>
              <li>Tasks should be updated and changed from time to time</li>
              <li>
                Ensure safety of the players by getting feedback from other
                players about the area

            I created 3 user personas based on my user research. They are the

            decisions easier. All of my personas enjoy challenges like solving

            Due to pandemic and limited accessibility, it was difficult to

            It's time to put my design to test! Using my Mid-Fidelity

          <h4>Conclusion</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Most of the participants are confused on how to use the Search box
              and the purpose of the Search box in the map. The main purpose of
              the Search box is to type an exact address where the participant
              wants to go or if the participant is going to a different address
              which is outside the neighborhood. Some think it is for finding
              friends in the game.

              Tutorials button should be eliminated in once the participant is

          <h2>Usability Results and Planning for Future Tests</h2>
          <p>
            Prototypes are meant to be perfected. I used Affinity Mapping and
            Rainbow Spreadsheet in methodically sorting out the results of my
            Usability Tests. I paid special attention to errors and their
            emotions while finishing a task.
          </p>
          <h4>Key Findings and Iterations</h4>
          <p>
            After considering what changes and improvements should be done for
            the users, I categorized which issue have the highest severity and
            which ones have low severity. I chose the top 5 most critical errors
            that needed iterations.

              Place the Invites button in the Players button to approve, block,
              report or ignore game friend requests. Players can also view
              existing friends or search for a specific name in the game.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add checkboxes for specific needs and requirements of the player

            <li>Change distance settings to slider</li>

            The Design System serves as a guide for developers of Schnitzeljagd
            to maintain consistency within the app in any platform.

            <h2>Final Iteration</h2>
            <p>
              The overall process of User Design is interesting, worthwhile, and
              challenging. The most challenging part is getting participants to
              test my project and using colors. My most favorite part are
              analyzing the data, creating wireframes, and conducting usability.
              <br />
              The whole process of UX Design has taught me to develop empathy
              and to put users first in making decisions about your app.
              Anything that is created from scratch will not guarantee that it
              will be implemented. Iteration is always a part of the process and
              it can change from 0 to anything. Always remember to help other UX
              Designers give respectful feedback and receive feedback openly.
              <br />
              I am thankful for the support of my family, friends, mentors and
              tutors who stick with me to finish this project.
