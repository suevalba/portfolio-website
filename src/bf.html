        <h3>User Story</h3>
        <p>
          As a special education teacher, I want to practice my British sign
          language skills and Maori language so that I can communicate better
          with my students and their parents.<br />
          As a wife, I want to start a family and be a mom<br />As a fresh
          graduate of I.T. Management, I want to move to the city so that I
          could get a job in the I.T. Industry and practice what I've learned.
        </p>
        <h3>Job Story</h3>
        <p>
          When on of my students expresses something, I want to respond to
          him/her accordingly so I can communicate with them in a way that we
          both understand. <br />When I move to the city, I want to make sure I
          am ready for my new career in I.T. so I can adjust to my new
          environment faster. <br />
          When I go to work, I want to explore nature and observe the city
          during my commute so I can be more familiar with the things around me.
        </p>
        <h2>Problem and Hypothesis Statement</h2>
        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
          Grace needs a way to adapt to her new environment by understanding the
          culture and language so she can communicate fluently to the people
          from all ages.
        </p>
        <h3>Hypothesis Statement</h3>
        <p>
          We believe that by building a feature where the mobile app can respond
          to your sentences and expressions will help Grace practice and learn
          more about the language and figure out if her pronunciation is
          correct.

        <h2>Paper Sketches</h2>
        <p>
          Crazy 8s and dot voting helped me decide my initial design ideas at an
          early stage
        </p>

        <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
        <p>
          I received real user feedback on the Wireframes and prototypes and
          here's what that they think
        </p>

        <h2>Prototyping and Iteration</h2>

        <p>
          I made changes to improve Brain Flash according to the feedback from
          users and below is a link to the prototype

        <h2>Learning Challenges</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Think about the concept first, then design later.</li>
          <li>
            Keep a copy of all your sketches, from Crazy 8s, to prototypes
            because you’ll never know when you need to go back to those ideas
            and use them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take note and value all the feedback from your user testers, but you
            don’t need to follow all of them.
          </li>
          <li>
            The whole process in this project makes me practice myself putting
            my shoes on the user’s experience.
          </li>
          <li>
            Getting users to test your prototype and setting an appointment with
            them is very challenging. It's best to widen network and ask help
            for friends too.
